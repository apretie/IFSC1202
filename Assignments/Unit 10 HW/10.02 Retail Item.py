#reate a class called RetailItem that holds data about an Item in a retail store.
#The class should have the following attributes:
#Description - description of the item (default "")
#UnitsOnHand - the number of units in inventory (default 0)
#Price - the item's retail price (default 0)
#Create a constructor that accepts the Description, UnitOnHand, and Price, then sets them to attributes in the RetailItem Class.
#If one of the attributes is not present, then set the attribute to the default value.
#Create a method called InventoryValue, which returns the UnitsOnHand times Price.
#Read the 10.02 Inventory.txt file and creates three objects, one for each item.
#Display a report that displays the Description, Units On Hand, Price, and Inventory Value
