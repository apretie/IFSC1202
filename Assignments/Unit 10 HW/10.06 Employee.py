#Create a class named Employee that has the following attributes:
    #FirstName
    #LastName
    #IDNumber
    #HoursWorked
    #Wage
#Create an initializer that accepts the FirstName, LastName, IDNumber, HoursWorked, and Wage and assigns them to the appropriate attribute.
#The Employee class should have method called WeeklyPay, which calculates the weekly pay.
#Weekly pay is defined as 1 times the wage for hours 0-40, and 1.5 times wage for hours greater than 40
#As you read each line from Payroll.txt, you will create one Employee object. You can reuse this object as you read the next employee.
#Print the FirstName, LastName, IDNumber, HoursWorked, HourlyWage, and WeeklyPay for each employee






#HW Output:
#First    Last      ID   Hours  Hourly  Weekly
    #Name    Name  Number  Worked    Wage     Pay
