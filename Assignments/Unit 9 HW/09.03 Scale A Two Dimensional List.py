#Create a function called print_list(a), where a is a two dimensional list. 
# The function should print the list row by row, with one space between each element
#Create a function called scale_list(a, s) that multiplies every value in the list by the scale factor, 
# where a is a two dimensional list s is the scale factor
#Read the values in the file 09.03 NumbersList.txt into a two dimensional array
#Print the list by calling print_list(a).
#Prompt for a scale factor.
#Multiply every value in the list by the scale factor using a function called scaled_list(a, s).
#Print the scaled list by calling print_list(a).
