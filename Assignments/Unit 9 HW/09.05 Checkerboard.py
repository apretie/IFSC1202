#Create a python program the creates a checkerboard pattern as shown.
#You should prompt for the size of the board (minus the frame).
#Create the checkerboard within a 2D array and print it out. Your solution should work for mulitple sizes.
#Hints:
    #Prompt to the size of the board (n)
    #Create an empty 2D List
    #Append the top of the board, consisting of an plus sign, n dashes, and a plus sign
    #For n times, append interior rows, consisting of a vertical bar, n spaces, and a vertical bar
    #Append the bottom of the board, consisting of an plus sign, n dashes, and a plus sign
    #Loop through the interior rows and columns; set the element to an asterisk if the column and row index are even/odd or odd/event
    #Loop through the entire board and and print the values.
