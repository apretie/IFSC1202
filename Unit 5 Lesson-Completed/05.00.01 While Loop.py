#Primarily, Python checks the condition.
#If it is False, the loop is terminated and the program performs instructions that go after the while loop.
#If the condition is True, the loop body is executed, and then the condition is checked again.
    #This continues while the condition is True.
#Once the condition becomes False, 
    #the loop terminates and the program performs instructions that go after the while loop.
