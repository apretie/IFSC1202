#Slices with two parameters never cause IndexError.  
   #For example, for s == 'Hello' the slice s[1:5] returns the string 'ello', and the result is the same as if the second index was very large, like s[1:100].

#If you omit the second parameter (but preserve the colon):
    #then the slice continues until the end of a string. 
    #For example, to remove the first character from a string (its index is 0) take the slice s[1:]. 
    #Similarly, if you omit the first parameter (s[:7]):
        #then Python takes the slice, starting at the beginning of a string.
        #That is, to remove the last character from a string, you can use slice s[:-1]. 
        #The slice s[:] is equal to a string s itself.
s = 'Hello'
print(s[1:5])    
print(s[1:100])  
print(s[1:])     
print(s[:-1])    
print(s[:])
